I have forked your repo and made few changes to RadioButtonsGroup.js to support default selection, group styling and radio alignment.

<RadioGroup style={{marginLeft: 32}}
    alignItems="left" defaultSelected={false} radioButtons={data} onPress={onPress} />

If you are interested with the changes, please add them to your repo.
